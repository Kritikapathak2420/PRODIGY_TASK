This is a fun and easy-to-play Tic-Tac-Toe game made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Two players can play by taking turns and marking X or O on a 3x3 board. The game automatically checks who wins or if it’s a draw after every move. The design is clean and works well on both computers and mobile phones. When someone wins, the winning line is clearly shown. There’s also a reset button so you can quickly start a new game. The main logic is written in JavaScript in a simple and well-organized way. CSS is used to make the layout look nice with some smooth effects. This project shows basic web development skills and is great for learning how to use JavaScript with HTML and CSS. It's a perfect mini project for beginners.
